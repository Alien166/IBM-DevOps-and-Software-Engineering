    C.      Data in use

    D.     Dynamic and static scanning of applications
    - A, B, and C only  
    - B and C only 
    - A and B only 
    - A, B, C, and D 
    ```
    Answer: A, B, and C only
    Explanation: Protecting data while it is at rest, in motion, and in use, gives you complete control over your data
    ```

2. What are some of the monitoring tools that help you to gain insights about your posture, compliance, and threats? _Select two_.
    - Hypervisors
    - Security events
    - Data encryption
    - Flow logs from the network
    ```
    Answer: Security events,
            Flow logs from the network.
    Explanation: Security events indicate when a security policy may have been violated,
                 Flow logs help to monitor information about how the network resources are operating.
    ```
    
3. What is the role SecDevOps plays in cloud security?
    - Provides policies, technological procedures, services, and solutions to secure the enterprise against security threats and breaches    
    - Security in the DevOps process helps embed security through the life cycle of an application    
    - Helps maintain visibility of all data exchanges between public, private, and hybrid cloud environments    
    - Identity and Access Management 
    ```
    Answer: Security in the DevOps process helps embed security through the life cycle of an application
    Explanation: Security embedded through the DevOps cycle helps to ensure that the application runs on a safe platform, the code is free from vulnerabilities, and operational risks are understood.
    ```
    
4. What are some of the benefits of using access groups? _Select two_.
    - Access groups provide a more streamlined way to assign access rights to a group of users and service IDs as compared to assigning individual access
    - Access groups create an additional level of authentication for application users 
    - Access groups define the users, the resources to which access is being granted, and the permission level that each user has on these resources
    - The use of access groups helps to reduce the number of policies in an account 
    ```
    Answer: Access groups provide a more streamlined way to assign access rights to a group of users and service IDs as compared to assigning individual access,
            The use of access groups helps to reduce the number of policies in an account.
    Explanation: Access groups make it possible to assign the same access to all entities within the group,
                 Access policies defined at a group level means lesser access policies, which in turn leads to increased performance.
    ```
    
5. Identify the two main parts of an encryption system from the provided options. _Select two_.
    - Server-side encryption
    - The encryption algorithm
    - The decryption key
    - Client-side encryption
    ```
    Answer: The encryption algorithm,
    Explanation: The encryption algorithm defines the rules by which data is scrambled so that it becomes illegible,
                 The decryption key defines how the encrypted data will be transformed back to legible data.

    ```
    
6. What are some of the benefits that cloud monitoring solutions offer? _Select two_.
    - Troubleshoot applications and infrastructure
    - Provide proactive notifications of abnormal or unusual situations
    - Accelerate the diagnosis and resolution of performance incidents
    - Prevent unauthorized users from accessing the systems 
    ```
    Answer: Provide proactive notifications of abnormal or unusual situations,
            Accelerate the diagnosis and resolution of performance incidents.
    Explanation: Cloud monitoring solutions help mitigate the impact of abnormal situations by providing proactive notifications,
                 Cloud monitoring solutions are designed to give organizations complete visibility and control over the performance of their cloud resources.
    ```
    
7. What are some of the common outcomes’ companies like The Weather Company, American Airlines, Cementos Pacasmayo, Welch Foods, and LiquidPower achieve with cloud migration?  
    A.     Meeting the information/service needs of their customers
    B.      Resolving their scalability challenge
    C.      Cost efficiencies
    - A and C only 
    - A and B only 
    - A, B, and C 
    - B and C only
    ```
    Answer: A, B, and C 
    Explanation: All are correct.
    ```
    
8. The Weather Company migrated its weather web property to a secure, scalable, and global architecture in the IBM Cloud. What are some of the benefits they realized as a result of this migration? _Select two_.
    - Increase asset availability and overall equipment effectiveness
    - Harness local data centers to minimize latency for users spread across the globe
    - Optimize their systems for elasticity in handling extreme spikes in demand which can mean a difference between life and death for its users
    - Faster development and release of new apps and digital self-service tools to customers
    ```
    Answer: Harness local data centers to minimize latency for users spread across the globe,
    Explanation: Since weather is a hyper-local phenomenon, the scalability of the web platform needs to be localized, which is made possible with cloud technologies,
                 With load peeking to over 100 million users in severe weather conditions and about 250 billion forecasts on-demand generated in a day, The Weather Company leveraged cloud’s scalability to handle massive, short-notice peak workloads.
    ```
    
9. What are some of the technical skills necessarily required for the role of Cloud Software Engineer? _Select two_.
    - Perform threat simulations to detect possible risks 
    - Proficiency in commonly used web application development languages, such as Python, JavaScript, Java, HTML, and CSS
    - Understanding existing systems to recommend automated integration of disparate data sets
    - Knowledge of data structures, distributed systems, operating systems, and algorithms
    ```
    Answer: Proficiency in commonly used web application development languages, such as Python, JavaScript, Java, HTML, and CSS,
            Knowledge of data structures, distributed systems, operating systems, and algorithms
    Explanation: Cloud Software Engineers work with the front- and back-end of applications, as well as platforms and systems that their applications run on. These technical skills are essential for their job,
                 Cloud Software Engineers work through all phases of the software development lifecycle—writing, testing, and maintaining code, making these skills essential for their job.
