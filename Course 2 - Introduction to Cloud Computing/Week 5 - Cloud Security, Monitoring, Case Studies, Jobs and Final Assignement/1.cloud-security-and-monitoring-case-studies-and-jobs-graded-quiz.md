# Cloud Security and Monitoring, Case Studies, and Jobs: Graded Quiz

1. What are some best practices organizations need to follow in order to protect their cloud resources and systems? _Select two_.
    - Active monitoring for security and compliance 
    - Distribute tasks, workloads, and network traffic
    - Adopt a shared responsibility model 
    - Run security monitoring tools on a periodic basis to ensure security threats and breaches are flagged 
    ```
    Answer: Active monitoring for security and compliance,
            Adopt a shared responsibility model.
    Explanation: To ensure stability and enforcement of compliance standards and business continuity, enterprises need to set up active monitoring of all connected systems and cloud-based services,

2. Which of the following are key components of Identity and Access Management (IAM)? _Select two_.
    - Cloud Directory Services 
    - Protecting data while it is at rest, in motion, and in use 
    - Audit and Compliance 
    - Embedding security through the life cycle of an application 
    ```
    Answer: Cloud Directory Services,
            Audit and Compliance.
    Explanation: Cloud Directory Services are used to manage user profiles and their associated credentials and password policy inside a cloud environment,
                 Audit and compliance is a critical service within the IAM framework. Auditors use these processes to validate implemented controls against an organization's security policy, industry compliance, and risk policies to report deviations.

    A.   Encryption ensures only authorized users have access to sensitive dat
    B.   When encrypted data is intercepted without authorization, it is unreadable and meaningles
    C.   Encryption protects data when it is at rest, in transit, and in use in memo
    D.   Encryption eliminates data security risk
    - A, B, and D only 
    - A, B, and C only 
    - A, B, C, and D
    - A and C only 
    ```
    Answer: A, B, and C only 
    Explanation: Encryption does not eliminate data security risk—it separates the security risk from the data itself by moving security to the encryption keys.
    ```

4. Identify some of the standard cloud monitoring best practices from the provided options. _Select two_. 
    - Track usage and cost of your cloud resources and services
    - Leverage end-user experience monitoring solutions to capture the performance of an application from the point of view of its end users
