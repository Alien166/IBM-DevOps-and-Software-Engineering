# Agile Planning

__User Stories__

- A user story documents a person requesting a function to achieve a goal.

- Using a template helps ensure that stories are complete. 

- Defining "done" helps minimize misunderstandings. 

- Use the INVEST acronym to remember the qualities of a good user story: independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable. 

- Epics can be used to capture big ideas. 

- Story points are a metric used to estimate the difficulty of implementing a given user story.

- Story points are relative, like T-Shirt sizes. 

- You must agree on what "average" means. 

- You should never equate story points with wall-clock time. 

- A product backlog is a ranked list of all unimplemented stories. 

- Stories high in the ranking should have more detail than those that are lower. 

- Create stories using the "As a", "I need", "So that" template to ensure everyone understands who it benefits and the business value it provides.

__The Planning Process__

- It is the product owner's responsibility to maintain a groomed backlog 

- Backlog refinement is used to order the product backlog and make stories sprint ready 

- You start refinement by triaging new issues 

- Large stories should be broken down until they are small enough to fit in a sprint 

- The goal of backlog refinement is to get the backlog ready for the sprint planning meeting 

- It is the product owner's responsibility to present the sprint goal 

- It is the development team’s responsibility to create a sprint plan 

- A sprint plan is created by moving stories from the product backlog into the sprint backlog until the team's velocity is reached
